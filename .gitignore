# Specific to this project if any other local files are generated
# For example, if HTML input files are temporary and shouldn't be committed:
# *.html (Be careful with this if you have HTML files you WANT to commit, like test.html)
# If test.html is a permanent test fixture, don't add *.html generally.
# Instead, be specific if needed, e.g. temp_*.html

# Java archives (if built locally and not intended for repo, e.g., from 'mvn package')
# *.jar
# *.war
# *.ear
